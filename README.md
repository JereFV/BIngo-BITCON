# Bingo BITCON

It is a simulation of bingo in Java, using Swing components for the interface. The user can play games (alone) in different modalities, first you need to configure the way that the numbers will be generate, automatic (the system generate the numbers automatically each time you put a button) or manual (the user must write what number they want to choose)After that, you choose in which numerical system you wanna play (like decimal, quinary, hexadecimal),  and finally you "draw" on tables which pattern of game bingo do you wanna play (vertical, four corners), you must draw three patterns to start the game and before start you pick one of them to play. The system will generate one hundred boards and you can play with all of themm, the game ends with some of the boards match with the pattern picked. (Like you are playing with one hundred boards, it means that would be several winners.)
